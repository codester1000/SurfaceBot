## Surfacing top contributors faster
Surface bot knows a small number of great contributors from Discord dictate the success of most communities. Most are identified by stats or moderators based on high volume activity. But thereâ€™s a critical gap around low volume or early-stage contributors who are high value and high potential. Surface bot identifies these contributors early via sentiment and referral analysis. We recognise those that are delivering real value but are currently unnoticed and may feel under appreciated.


## Constraints / Blockers
We are not completely sure what data is available to bots, and if the data can be accessed only from the moment of implementation forward. 
Data that I want to collect is difficult, and needs a lot of work around and processing to scrape.
Some of the blockers I have encountered 

## Success Criteria
The project will be successful when these 3 things will be achieved:
1.	A working database full of data on every user
2.	An integrated dashboard for leaders of communities to view their top achievers
3.	We will be able to identify users that are helpful in the community, that the leaders of the community are not already aware of.

This project will never really be complete there is always more data out there and more processing to do on that data in order to give more information to the moderators and owners of the discord


## MVP 
A website that will display the amount of messages sent in a discord chat and will sort the amount of messages per user, this will be displayed in a dashboard. The dashboard seen above is a mockup of the final dashboard and what data may be displayed.
